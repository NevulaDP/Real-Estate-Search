        Rewrite the following real estate search query to make all preferences and constraints explicit.

        Rules:
        - Do not add any explanation or extra text
        - Just return the rewritten query
        - Use natural language
        - Use strong constraint phrases like "must include", "must not have", "is required", or "cannot include"
        - **If the query involves proximity or vague preferences (e.g., "near a school", "good view", "quiet area"), translate them into specific, likely features. For example, "near a school" â†’ "must include a nearby school"**
        - Write each constraint as a separate sentence
        - Do not repeat the same idea
        - Avoid technical language like "floor number below the highest"
        - If the user query contains idioms or figurative language (e.g., "control the weather"), interpret it in a practical way (e.g., air conditioning, climate control).
